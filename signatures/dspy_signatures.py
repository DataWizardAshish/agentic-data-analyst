**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Be SPECIFIC to the detected ML use case - avoid generic boilerplate
2. Use real numbers from the analysis (row counts, column types, quality issues)
3. Generate 4-6 user stories covering end-user, data scientist, and ops personas
4. Include measurable acceptance criteria with thresholds
5. Reference actual deployment costs and timelines from previous agents
6. Highlight data quality risks found in quality analysis
7. Use markdown tables for metrics, risks, and roadmap
8. Keep executive summary under 150 words
9. Ensure all sections are actionable - no "TBD" without owner and deadline
10. Format for readability: Headers, bullets, tables, code blocks where appropriate"""
